<h2 style="text-align: center;">Thank you for checking out my website, where I strive to *conserve aquatic biodiversity in a changing world*</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">

<p style="text-align: justify;">My primary focus concerns global change biology through examining impacts on marine-freshwater (diadromous) migrants, and the greater task of conserving environmental flows. I have a broad interest in natural history and conservation, and continue to be involved in research of freshwater invasions, the wildlife trade, and the systematics of East-Asian minnows and caridean shrimps. A core philosophy is making my work translatable to actionable policy, and I have undertaken regional assessments of conservation statuses for freshwater biodiversity with WWF Hong Kong and advised the Hong Kong Government's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. I also believe there is a misalignment between research and education, and I attempt to bridge this through the conservation organization that I founded, [Freshwater Collective](https://www.freshwatercollective.org).</p>
