:::{#hero-heading}

<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, I'm a final year PhD candidate at The University of Hong Kong working with [David Dudgeon](https://www.biosch.hku.hk/ecology/dd.htm) and [Jia Huan Liew](https://discover.utas.edu.au/JiaHuan.Liew) on the impacts of fragmentation by dams on diadromous species at global and regional scales. Previously, I received an MRes in Tropical Forest Ecology from Imperial College London examining  multiple-stressor interactions on ecosystem functioning using pond mesocosms with [Guy Woodward](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/guy.woodward) (I was landlocked during covid). Prior to my academic journey I founded [Freshwater Collective](https://www.freshwatercollective.org), a conservation organization with the aim of bridging the gap between research and education of freshwater ecology.</p>
